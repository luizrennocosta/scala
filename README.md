# DISCLAIMER

This repo is a collection of exercises for the coursera **Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark** course. 
However, since I am just auditing the course, I try not to look at the given code and implement everything on my own,
so if you are reading this, please do not expect any sort of optimization or advanced syntax, or even "good" Scala code standards. 

Each week will be comprised (at least for now) of a *weekX.scala* file, which should hold all code regarding that week's exercise.
A specific README.md will probably hold each week's exercise summary, so if you want to make any criticism, you're welcome to.
